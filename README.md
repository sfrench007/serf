# SERF
Code and example data from a synthetic compound phenotypic screen identifying growth-inhibitory efflux substrates in E. coli

This code snippet accompanies the manuscript "Physicochemical and structural parameters contributing to the 
antibacterial activity and efflux susceptibility of small molecule inhibitors of Escherichia coli", by 
El Zahed et al. (2020).  It uses example data found at github.com/sfrench007/serf, and builds a random forest 
model to predict molecules that are actively pumped in E. coli.  

The code borrows from the elegant work by Richter et al. (2017; https://www.nature.com/articles/nature22308),
which is found at https://github.com/HergenrotherLab/GramNegAccum.
